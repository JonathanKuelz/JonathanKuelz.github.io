Currently, I am a doctoral student at the Technical University of Munich under supervision of [Matthias Althoff](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/people/prof-dr-ing-matthias-althoff/).
There, I work on algorithms to optimize the configuration and morphology of modular robot assemblies.

## Research
**Modular robots** (as developed by [RobCo](https://www.robco.de/), [Hebi](https://www.hebirobotics.com/), or [Beckhoff](https://www.beckhoff.com/de-de/produkte/motion/atro-automation-technology-for-robotics/)) pose an interesting opportunity to enable small- and medium sized companies automatizing repetitive or dangerous tasks without the need for expensive and highly specialized robotic hardware or fully-autonomous production lines.
If you want to learn more about my research, you can visit my [website at TUM](https://www.ce.cit.tum.de/air/people/jonathan-kuelz/).

## Callsheep
Together with [Lars Carius](https://lars.carius.io/) and [Florian Schumann](https://www.linkedin.com/in/florian-schumann-4025261a7/), I am one of the founders of [callsheep](https://callsheep.de/).
callsheep is a productivity tool for media producers and freelancers, digitizing production planning, coordination, and scheduling.
It's available for Android, iOS, and as web app.

## Chicken
Together with [Lars Carius](https://lars.carius.io/) and [Jan Carius](https://jan.carius.io/), I was one of the founders of the infamous [Chicken Technologies](https://chicken-technologies.com/).
Chicken was good, chicken was great, but chicken takes a break currently.
