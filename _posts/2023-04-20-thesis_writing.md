First of all, I am happy that you are considering writing your thesis with me.
A bachelor's or master's thesis or an internship is a great opportunity to get to know a research group and to get a first impression of what it is like to work in academia.
In fact, this will most likely be one of the first times that you will be working on a research project that is not directly related to your studies.
As a thesis student, you are the researcher, and you are responsible for the project.
My role as a supervisor is to support you, to help you with your research, and to guide you through the process of writing a thesis.
Other than in a lecture, you have to at least partially define the scope of your project yourself.
To help me understand the progress you have made, I will ask you to prepare our meetings in a standardized way (see below).

## Research Proposal
Before we start working together, I would like you to write a research proposal.
This proposal should summarize:
- the research question that you want to answer, 
- why this is an important question,
- the state of the art,
- and the methods that you want to use to answer your research question
on a high level (1-2 pages).
Furthermore, please include a timeline for your project with important milestones you will need to reach.
This helps to avoid communication problems and misunderstandings about your topic and will later on be a valuable resource to keep track of your progress and structure your thesis.

## Shared Folder
When you start a thesis with me, please create a shared folder (preferably a Google Drive) that contains all files that we will be working on.
This folder should be accessible to me and to you.
Within this folder, there should be one master document named `<YOUR_NAME>_<YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>` that contains an index with an explanation on folder structure,
your start and end dates, and a link to your research proposal, also placed in the shared folder.
Also, there should be one `protocol` file that will be updated continuously by you and me and serves as ground of discussion in our meetings.

## Structuring of Meetings
For our meetings, please prepare:
- Questions that you have the latest 1h before the meeting at the top of the protocol file
- A short summary (can be screenshots, can be a document, can be a presentation) of your progress since the last meeting
- Relevant screenshots, plots, figures
A clear and structured preparation will help us to make the most out of our meetings.
This also helps you to keep track of your progress and to stay motivated -- use your weekly summaries to write your thesis.
I highly recommend reading [this blog post about successful meetings](https://medium.com/@jurgens_24580/reflections-on-strategies-for-successful-meetings-with-undergraduate-researchers-ae22306ecd8d) to make the most out of our meetings.
